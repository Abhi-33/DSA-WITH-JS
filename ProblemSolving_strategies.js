//Problem Solving Strategies 
//1) UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM 

//PROBLEM : Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum.

//1. Can i restate the problem in my own words ?
      "implement addition"
//2. What are the inputs that go into the problem ?
    //  -ints?
    //  -floats?
    //  - what about string for large numbers ? 
//3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem ?
        // -ints? floatS? strings?
//4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs ? (do i have enough information to solve the problem)
//5. How should i label the pieces of data that are a part of the problem ?

// example of how basic function will look like 
function sum (a,b){
    return a+b;
}
// console.log(sum(5,6));
